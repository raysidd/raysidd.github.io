  <center><h1>Design & Technology Chair Design</h2></center>
    <center><p>This project was a concept chair idea. I designed this
      product myself and also went through a lot of market research in order to
      make this idea a reality. I made multiple prototypes of this product
      in order to reach the final product which was sadly interrupted by
      the pandemic, hence the completion of my design was never seen.</p>

               <center><p>This project was a recipe bot I coded for my
               work in my Procedural Programming module. This project was created
             to display my java skills and displays how responsive code works. I have displayed below
           the file which can be downloaded and ran.</p>

                        <center><h1>PC Build</h2></center>
                          <center><p>This project I collaborated with a team
                          in order to build a PC. At the time of building this, I was in the first semester of my
                        Computer Science degree. I decided building a PC would further my knowledge on the hardware aspect of Computing.
                      The PC build was completed with all components functioning.</p>
